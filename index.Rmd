# Introduction

This is a _workflow_ book written in **Markdown**. You could contribute it by a pull request.

[**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) and [**Rstudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/) are the softwares needed in this workflow.

The software package used for metabolomics data analysis is **xcms**

The workflow of the metabolomic study always began with data collection and ended with certain scientific problem. It always showed the following workflow:

1. Project Setup
2. Experimental design(DoE)
3. Raw data pretreatment
4. Peaks selection
5. Omics analysis
6. Common analysis methods for metabolomics
7. Demo
