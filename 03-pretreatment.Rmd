# Pretreatment

Pretreatment will affect the results of metabolomics. For example, feces collected with 95% ethanol or FOBT would be more reproducible and stable.

Dmitri et.al[@sitnikov2016] thought the most orthogonal methods to methanol-based precipitation were ion-exchange solid-phase extraction and liquid-liquid extraction using methyl-tertbutyl ether. 

## Quenching

Quenching solvent is always used to stop stop enzymatic activity. 

In this review[@lu2017], authors said:

> A classical approach, which works well for many analytes, is boiling ethanol. Although the boiling solvent raises concerns about thermal degradation, it reliably denatures enzymes. In contrast, cold organic solvent may not fully denature enzymes or may do so too slowly such that some metabolic reactions continue, interconverting metabolites during the quenching process.

## Extraction

According to this research[@bennett2009]:

> The total metabolome concentration is approximately 300 mM, whereas the protein concentration is approximately 7 mM., which implies that most cellular metabolites are in free form.

- Tissue samples need to first be pulverized into fine powders

In this review[@lu2017], authors said:

> In our experience, for both cell and tissue specimens, 40:40:20 acetonitrile:methanol:water with 0.1 M formic acid (and subsequent neutralization with ammonium bicarbonate) is generally an effective solvent system for both quenching and extraction, including for ATP and other high-energy phosphorylated compounds. We typically use approximately 1 mL of solvent mix to extract 25 mg of biological specimen. ...Thus, although drying is acceptable for most metabolites, care must be taken with redox-active species.
