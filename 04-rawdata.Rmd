# Raw data pretreatment

Raw data from the instruments such as LC-MS or GC-MS were hard to be analyzed. To make it clear, the structure of those data could be summarised as:

- To get full infomation in the samples, full scan is perferred
- Full scan is performed synchronously with the seperation process

GC/LC-MS data are usually be shown as a matrix with column standing for retention times and row standing for masses. Noises are so much that such data could not be processed effeciently.

```{r singledata, fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Demo of GC/LC-MS data',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/singledata.png')
```

Conversation from the mass-retention time matrix into a vector with selected MS peaks at certain retention time is the basic idea of the Raw data pretreatment. The **Centwave** algorithm[@tautenhahn2008] based on detection of regions of interest(ROI) and the following Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for the peaks is preferred for high-resolution mass spectrum.

With many groups of samples, you will get another data matrix with column standing for ions at cerntain retention time and row standing for samples after the Raw data pretreatment.

```{r multidata, fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Demo of many GC/LC-MS data',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/multidata.png')
```

## Spectral deconvolution

Without fracmental infomation about certain compound, the peak extraction would suffer influnces from other compounds. At the same retention time, co-elute compounds might share similar mass. Hard electron ionization methods such as electron impact ionization (EI), APPI suffer this issue. So it would be hard to distighuish the co-elute peaks' origin and deconvolution method[
@du2013] could be used to seperate different groups according to the similar chromatogragh beheviors. Another computational tool **eRah** could be a better solution for the whole process[@domingo-almenara2016]. Also the **ADAD-GC3.0** could also be helpful for such issue[@ni2016].

## Retention Time Correction

However, before you get the peaks, some corrections should be performed such as mass shift and retention time shift. The basic idea behind retention time correction is that use the high quality grouped peaks to make a new retention time. You might choose obiwarp or loess regression method to get the corrected retention time for all of the samples. Remember the original retention times might be changed and you might need cross-correct the data.

## Dynamic Range

Another issue is the Dynamic Range. For metabolomics, peaks could be below the detection limit or over the detection limit. Such Dynamic range issues might raise the loss of information.

### Non-detects

Some of the data were limited by the detect of limitation. Thus we need some methods to impute the data if we don't want to lose information by deleting the NA or 0.

Two major imputation way could be used. The first way is use model-free method such as half the minimum of the values across the data, 0, 1, mean/median across the data( `enviGCMS` package could do this via `getimputation` function). The second way is use model-based method such as linear model, random forest, KNN, PCA. Try `simputation` package for various imputation methods.

Tobit regression is preferred for censored data. Also you might choose  maximum likelihood estimation(Estimation of mean and standard deviation by MLE. Creating 10 complete samples. Pool the results from 10 individual analyses).

```{r tobit,cache=TRUE}
x <- rnorm(1000,1)
x[x<0] <- 0
y <- x*10+1
library(AER)
tfit <- tobit(y ~ x, left = 0)
summary(tfit)
```

### Over Detection Limit

**CorrectOverloadedPeaks** could be used to correct the Peaks Exceeding the Detection Limit issue[@lisec2016].

## RSD Filter

Some peaks need to be rule out due to high RSD%.

## Power Analysis Filter

The power analysis in metabolomics is ad-hoc since you don't know too much before you perform the experiment. However, we could perform power analysis after the experiment done. That is, we just rule out the peaks with a lower power in exsit DoE.

## Batch Effects

### Distribution of intensity

Intensity collects from LC/GC-MS always showed a right-skewed distribution. Log transformation is often necessary for further statistical analysis. In some case, a Log-transformated intensity could be visulizated easily.

Here is a simulation of such data:

```{r simintensity}
rtmzsim <- function(npeaks = 1000, nspeaks = 50, nbatch = 3, ncond = 2, npercond = 10,
                       basemean = 10000, ppstep = 50, bbstep = 2000, ccstep = 800,
                       basedisp = 100, bdispstep = 10, swvar = 1000, seed = 42) {
        set.seed(seed)
        mu <- seq(0, length.out = npeaks, by = ppstep)
        bmu <- seq(0, length.out = nbatch, by = bbstep)
        cmu <- seq(0, length.out = ncond, by = ccstep)
        bsize <- seq(basedisp, length.out = nbatch, by = bdispstep)
        ncol <- nbatch * ncond * npercond
        batch <- rep(1:nbatch, each=ncond*npercond)
        condition <- rep(rep(1:ncond, each=npercond), nbatch)
        bc <- paste0('C',condition,'B',batch)
        A.matrix <- matrix(0, nrow = npeaks, ncol = ncol)
        colnames(A.matrix) <- bc

        samplewisevar <- swvar*rbeta(ncol,2,2)
        for (i in 1:nspeaks) {
                peaki <- c()
                for (j in 1:nbatch) {
                        for (k in 1:ncond) {
                                for (l in 1:npercond) {
                                        peaki <- c(peaki, rnbinom(1, size = bsize[j],
                                                                  mu = basemean+mu[i]+bmu[j]+cmu[k]+samplewisevar[j*k*l]))
                                }
                        }
                }
                A.matrix[i, ] <- peaki
        }
        for (i in (nspeaks+1):npeaks) {
                peaki <- c()
                for (l in 1:npercond) {
                                        peaki <- c(peaki, rnbinom(1, size = bsize[j],
                                                                  mu = basemean+mu[i]+mean(cmu)+mean(bmu)+samplewisevar[j*l]))
                                }

        }
        rownames(A.matrix) <- paste0('P',c(1:npeaks))
        return(A.matrix)
}
sim <- rtmzsim()

library(BioMark)
data("SpikePos")
data <- t(SpikePos$data)
lv <- as.factor(c(rep('C',10),rep('1',10),rep('2',10),rep('3',10)))

plotrla <- function(data, lv, rsdcf = 30, inscf = 1, type = 'g'){
        mean <- stats::aggregate(t(data), list(lv), mean)
        sd <- stats::aggregate(t(data), list(lv), sd)

              outmat <- sweep(data, 1, median, "-")

### Centering

For peak p of sample s in batch b, the corrected abundance I is:

$$\hat I_{p,s,b} = I_{p,s,b} - mean(I_{p,b}) + median(I_{p,qc})$$

For example, we have the intensities of one peak from ten samples in two batches like the following demo:

```{r center}
set.seed(42)
# raw data
I = c(rnorm(10,mean = 0, sd = 0.5),rnorm(10,mean = 1, sd = 0.5))
# batch
B = c(rep(0,10),rep(1,10))
# qc
Iqc = c(rnorm(1,mean = 0, sd = 0.5),rnorm(1,mean = 1, sd = 0.5))
# corrected data
Icor = I - c(rep(mean(I[1:10]),10),rep(mean(I[11:20]),10)) + median(Iqc)
# plot the result
plot(I)
plot(Icor)
```

### Scaling

For peak p of sample s in certain batch b, the corrected abundance I is:

$$\hat I_{p,s,b} = \frac{I_{p,s,b} - mean(I_{p,b})}{std_{p,b}} * std_{p,qc,b} + mean(I_{p,qc,b})$$

For example, we have the intensities of one peak from ten samples in two batches like the following demo:

```{r scaling}
set.seed(42)
# raw data
I = c(rnorm(10,mean = 0, sd = 0.3),rnorm(10,mean = 1, sd = 0.5))
# batch
B = c(rep(0,10),rep(1,10))
# qc
Iqc = c(rnorm(1,mean = 0, sd = 0.3),rnorm(1,mean = 1, sd = 0.5))
# corrected data
Icor = (I - c(rep(mean(I[1:10]),10),rep(mean(I[11:20]),10)))/c(sd(I[1:10]),sd(I[11:20]))*c(rep(0.3,10),rep(0.5,10)) + Iqc[1]
# plot the result
plot(I)
plot(Icor)
```

### Quantile

The idea of quantile calibration is that alignment of the intensities in certain samples according to quantiles in each sample.

Here is the demo:

```{r quantile, cache=T}
set.seed(42)
a <- rnorm(1000)
# b sufferred batch effect with a bias of 10
b <- rnorm(1000,10)
hist(a,xlim=c(-5,15),breaks = 50)
hist(b,col = 'black', breaks = 50, add=T)
# quantile normalized
cor <- (a[order(a)]+b[order(b)])/2
# reorder
cor <- cor[order(order(a))]
hist(cor,col = 'red', breaks = 50, add=T)
```

### Ratio based calibraton

This method calibrates samples by the ratio between qc samples in all samples and in certain batch.For peak p of sample s in certain batch b, the corrected abundance I is:

$$\hat I_{p,s,b} = \frac{I_{p,s,b} * median(I_{p,qc})}{mean_{p,qc,b}}$$

```{r ratio}
set.seed(42)
# raw data
I = c(rnorm(10,mean = 0, sd = 0.3),rnorm(10,mean = 1, sd = 0.5))
# batch
B = c(rep(0,10),rep(1,10))
# qc
Iqc = c(rnorm(1,mean = 0, sd = 0.3),rnorm(1,mean = 1, sd = 0.5))
# corrected data
Icor = I * median(c(rep(Iqc[1],10),rep(Iqc[2],10)))/mean(c(rep(Iqc[1],10),rep(Iqc[2],10)))
# plot the result
plot(I)
plot(Icor)
```

### Linear Normalizer

This method initially scales each sample so that the sum of all
peak abundances equals one. In this study, by multiplying the median sum of all peak abundances across all samples,we got the corrected data.

```{r Linear}
set.seed(42)
# raw data
peaksa <- c(rnorm(10,mean = 10, sd = 0.3),rnorm(10,mean = 20, sd = 0.5))
peaksb <- c(rnorm(10,mean = 10, sd = 0.3),rnorm(10,mean = 20, sd = 0.5))

df <- rbind(peaksa,peaksb)
dfcor <- df/apply(df,2,sum)* sum(apply(df,2,median))

image(df)
image(dfcor)
```

### Regression calibration

Considering the batch effect of injection order, regress the data by a linear model to get the calibration.

### Batch Normalizer

Use the total abundance scale and then fit with the regression line[@wang2013].

### Internal standards

$$\hat I_{p,s} = \frac{I_{p,s} * median(I_{IS})}{I_{IS,s}}$$

Some methods also use pooled calibration samples and multiple internal standard strategy to correct the data[@van_der_kloet2009]. Also some methods only use QC samples to handle the data[@kuligowski2015].
