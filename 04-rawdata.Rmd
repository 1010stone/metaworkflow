# Raw data pretreatment

Raw data from the instruments such as LC-MS or GC-MS were hard to be analyzed. To make it clear, the structure of those data could be summarised as:

- Indexed scan with time-stamp

- Each scan contain a full scan mass spetrum with intensities

## Peak extraction

GC/LC-MS data are usually be shown as a matrix with column standing for retention times and row standing for masses after bin them into small cell.

```{r singledata, fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Demo of GC/LC-MS data',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/singledata.png')
```

Conversation from the mass-retention time matrix into a vector with selected MS peaks at certain retention time is the basic idea of Peak extraction. You could EIC for each mass to charge ratio and use the change of trace slope  to determine whether there is a peak or not. Then we could make integration for this peak and get peak area and retention time.

```{r demoeic, fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Demo of EIC with peak'}
intensity <- c(10,10,10,10,10,14,19,25,30,33,26,21,16,12,11,10,9,10,11,10)
time <- c(1:20)
plot(trace~time, type = 'o', main = 'EIC')
```

However, in mass spectrumetry dataset, the EIC is not that simple for full scan. Due to the accuracy of instrument, the detected mass to charge ratio would have some shift and EIC would fail if different scan get the intensity from different mass to charge ratio. 

In the `matchedfilter` algorithm[@smith2006], they solve this issue by bin the data in m/z dimension. The adjacent chromatographic slices could be combined to find a clean signal fitting fixed second-derivative Gaussian with full width at half-maximum
(fwhm) of 30s to find peaks with about 1.5-4 times the signal peak width. The the integration is performed on the fitted area.

```{r matchedfilter, fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Demo of matchedfilter',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/matchedfilter.jpg')
```


The `Centwave` algorithm[@tautenhahn2008] based on detection of regions of interest(ROI) and the following Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is preferred for high-resolution mass spectrum. ROI means a regine with stable mass for a certain time. When we find the ROIs, the peak shape is evaluated and ROI could be extended if needed. This algotithm use `prefilter` to accelerate the processing speed. `prefilter` with 3 and 100 means the ROI should contain 3 scan with intensity above 100. Centwave use a peak width range which should be checked on pool QC. Another important parameter is `ppm`. It is the maximum allowed deviation between scans when locating regions of interest (ROIs), which is different from vendor number and you need to extend them larger than the company claimed. For `profparam`, it's used for fill peaks or align peaks instead of peak picking. `snthr` is the cutoff of signal to noise ratio.

## Retention Time Correction

For single file, we could get peaks. However, we should make the peaks align across samples for subsquece analysis and retention time corrections should be performed. The basic idea behind retention time correction is that use the high quality grouped peaks to make a new retention time. You might choose `obiwarp`(for dramatic shifts) or loess regression(fast) method to get the corrected retention time for all of the samples. Remember the original retention times might be changed and you might need cross-correct the data. After the correction, you could group the peaks again for a better cross-sample peaks list. However, if you directly use `obiwarp`, you don't have to group peaks before correction.

## Filling missing values

Too many zeros in peaks list are problematic for statistics. Then we usually need to integreate the area exsiting a peak. `xcms 3` could use profile matrix instead of profil matrix, which limited the range.

With many groups of samples, you will get another data matrix with column standing for peaks at cerntain retention time and row standing for samples after the Raw data pretreatment.

```{r multidata, fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Demo of many GC/LC-MS data',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/multidata.png')
```

## Spectral deconvolution

Without fracmental infomation about certain compound, the peak extraction would suffer influnces from other compounds. At the same retention time, co-elute compounds might share similar mass. Hard electron ionization methods such as electron impact ionization (EI), APPI suffer this issue. So it would be hard to distighuish the co-elute peaks' origin and deconvolution method[
@du2013] could be used to seperate different groups according to the similar chromatogragh beheviors. Another computational tool **eRah** could be a better solution for the whole process[@domingo-almenara2016]. Also the **ADAD-GC3.0** could also be helpful for such issue[@ni2016].

## Dynamic Range

Another issue is the Dynamic Range. For metabolomics, peaks could be below the detection limit or over the detection limit. Such Dynamic range issues might raise the loss of information.

### Non-detects

Some of the data were limited by the detect of limitation. Thus we need some methods to impute the data if we don't want to lose information by deleting the NA or 0.

Two major imputation way could be used. The first way is use model-free method such as half the minimum of the values across the data, 0, 1, mean/median across the data( `enviGCMS` package could do this via `getimputation` function). The second way is use model-based method such as linear model, random forest, KNN, PCA. Try `simputation` package for various imputation methods.

Tobit regression is preferred for censored data. Also you might choose  maximum likelihood estimation(Estimation of mean and standard deviation by MLE. Creating 10 complete samples. Pool the results from 10 individual analyses).

```{r tobit,cache=TRUE}
x <- rnorm(1000,1)
x[x<0] <- 0
y <- x*10+1
library(AER)
tfit <- tobit(y ~ x, left = 0)
summary(tfit)
```

### Over Detection Limit

**CorrectOverloadedPeaks** could be used to correct the Peaks Exceeding the Detection Limit issue[@lisec2016].

## RSD Filter

Some peaks need to be rule out due to high RSD%. See [Exprimental design(DoE)]

## Power Analysis Filter

As shown in [Exprimental design(DoE)], the power analysis in metabolomics is ad-hoc since you don't know too much before you perform the experiment. However, we could perform power analysis after the experiment done. That is, we just rule out the peaks with a lower power in exsit Exprimental design.

## Normalization

Variances among the samples across all the extracted peaks might be affected by factors other than the experiment design. To make the samples comparable, normailization across the samples are always needed. There are more than 20 methods to make normalization. We could devided those methods into two category: unsupervised and supervised.

Unsupervised methods only consider the normalization peaks intensity distribution across the samples. For example, quantile calibration try to make the intensity distribution among the samples similar. Such methods are preferred to explore the inner structures of the samples. Internal standards or pool QC samples also belong to this category. However, it's hard to take a few peaks standing for all peaks extracted.

Supervised methods will use the group information or batch information in experimental design to normalize the data. A linear model is always used to model the unwanted variances and remove them for further analysis.

Since the real batch effects are always unknown, it's hard to make validation for different normalization methods. Wu et.al preferred to make comparision between new methods and conventional methods[@wu2016]. Li et.al developed NOREVA to make comparision among 25 correction method[@li2017a]. Another idea is use spiked-in samples to validate the methods[@franceschi2012], which might be good for targeted analysis instead of non-targeted analysis.

Relative log abundance (RLA) plots[@delivera2012] and heatmap often used to show the variances among the samples.

[@thonusin2017] some methods for batch correction in excel

### Unsupervised methods

#### Distribution of intensity

Intensity collects from LC/GC-MS always showed a right-skewed distribution. Log transformation is often necessary for further statistical analysis. In some case, a Log-transformated intensity could be visulizated easily.

#### Centering

For peak p of sample s in batch b, the corrected abundance I is:

$$\hat I_{p,s,b} = I_{p,s,b} - mean(I_{p,b}) + median(I_{p,qc})$$

For example, we have the intensities of one peak from ten samples in two batches like the following demo:

```{r center}
set.seed(42)
# raw data
I = c(rnorm(10,mean = 0, sd = 0.5),rnorm(10,mean = 1, sd = 0.5))
# batch
B = c(rep(0,10),rep(1,10))
# qc
Iqc = c(rnorm(1,mean = 0, sd = 0.5),rnorm(1,mean = 1, sd = 0.5))
# corrected data
Icor = I - c(rep(mean(I[1:10]),10),rep(mean(I[11:20]),10)) + median(Iqc)
# plot the result
plot(I)
plot(Icor)
```

#### Scaling

For peak p of sample s in certain batch b, the corrected abundance I is:

$$\hat I_{p,s,b} = \frac{I_{p,s,b} - mean(I_{p,b})}{std_{p,b}} * std_{p,qc,b} + mean(I_{p,qc,b})$$

For example, we have the intensities of one peak from ten samples in two batches like the following demo:

```{r scaling}
set.seed(42)
# raw data
I = c(rnorm(10,mean = 0, sd = 0.3),rnorm(10,mean = 1, sd = 0.5))
# batch
B = c(rep(0,10),rep(1,10))
# qc
Iqc = c(rnorm(1,mean = 0, sd = 0.3),rnorm(1,mean = 1, sd = 0.5))
# corrected data
Icor = (I - c(rep(mean(I[1:10]),10),rep(mean(I[11:20]),10)))/c(sd(I[1:10]),sd(I[11:20]))*c(rep(0.3,10),rep(0.5,10)) + Iqc[1]
# plot the result
plot(I)
plot(Icor)
```

#### Quantile

The idea of quantile calibration is that alignment of the intensities in certain samples according to quantiles in each sample.

Here is the demo:

```{r quantile, cache=T}
set.seed(42)
a <- rnorm(1000)
# b sufferred batch effect with a bias of 10
b <- rnorm(1000,10)
hist(a,xlim=c(-5,15),breaks = 50)
hist(b,col = 'black', breaks = 50, add=T)
# quantile normalized
cor <- (a[order(a)]+b[order(b)])/2
# reorder
cor <- cor[order(order(a))]
hist(cor,col = 'red', breaks = 50, add=T)
```

#### Ratio based calibraton

This method calibrates samples by the ratio between qc samples in all samples and in certain batch.For peak p of sample s in certain batch b, the corrected abundance I is:

$$\hat I_{p,s,b} = \frac{I_{p,s,b} * median(I_{p,qc})}{mean_{p,qc,b}}$$

```{r ratio}
set.seed(42)
# raw data
I = c(rnorm(10,mean = 0, sd = 0.3),rnorm(10,mean = 1, sd = 0.5))
# batch
B = c(rep(0,10),rep(1,10))
# qc
Iqc = c(rnorm(1,mean = 0, sd = 0.3),rnorm(1,mean = 1, sd = 0.5))
# corrected data
Icor = I * median(c(rep(Iqc[1],10),rep(Iqc[2],10)))/mean(c(rep(Iqc[1],10),rep(Iqc[2],10)))
# plot the result
plot(I)
plot(Icor)
```

#### Linear Normalizer

This method initially scales each sample so that the sum of all
peak abundances equals one. In this study, by multiplying the median sum of all peak abundances across all samples,we got the corrected data.

```{r Linear}
set.seed(42)
# raw data
peaksa <- c(rnorm(10,mean = 10, sd = 0.3),rnorm(10,mean = 20, sd = 0.5))
peaksb <- c(rnorm(10,mean = 10, sd = 0.3),rnorm(10,mean = 20, sd = 0.5))

df <- rbind(peaksa,peaksb)
dfcor <- df/apply(df,2,sum)* sum(apply(df,2,median))

image(df)
image(dfcor)
```

#### Internal standards

$$\hat I_{p,s} = \frac{I_{p,s} * median(I_{IS})}{I_{IS,s}}$$

Some methods also use pooled calibration samples and multiple internal standard strategy to correct the data[@van_der_kloet2009]. Also some methods only use QC samples to handle the data[@kuligowski2015].


### Supervised methods

#### Regression calibration

Considering the batch effect of injection order, regress the data by a linear model to get the calibration.

#### Batch Normalizer

Use the total abundance scale and then fit with the regression line[@wang2013].

#### Surrogate Variable Analysis(SVA)

We have a data matrix(M*N) with M stands for indentity peaks from one sample and N stand for individual samples. For one sample, $X = (x_{i1},...,x_{in})^T$ stands for the normalized intensities of peaks. We use $Y = (y_i,...,y_m)^T$ stands for the group infomation of our data. Then we could build such modles:

$$x_{ij} = \mu_i + f_i(y_i) + e_{ij}$$

$\mu_i$ stands for the baseline of the peak intensities in a normal state. Then we have:

$$f_i(y_i) = E(x_{ij}|y_j) - \mu_i$$

stands for the biological variations caused by the our group, for example, whether treated by pollutions or not.

However, considering the batch effects, the real model could be:

$$x_{ij} = \mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \sum_{l = 1}^L \gamma_{li}p_{lj} + e_{ij}^*$$
 $\gamma_{li}$ stands for the peak-specific coefficient for potentical factor $l$. $p_{lj}$ stands for the potential factors across the samples. Actually, the error item $e_{ij}$ in real sample could always be decomposed as $e_{ij} = \sum_{l = 1}^L \gamma_{li}p_{lj} + e_{ij}^*$ with $e_{ij}^*$ standing for the real random error in certain sample for certain peak.
 
We could not get the potential factors directly. Since we don't care the details of the unknown factors, we could estimate orthogonal vectors $h_k$ standing for such potential factors. Thus we have:

$$
x_{ij} = \mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \sum_{l = 1}^L \gamma_{li}p_{lj} + e_{ij}^*\\ 
= \mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \sum_{k = 1}^K \lambda_{ki}h_{kj} + e_{ij}
$$

Here is the details of the algorithm:

> The algorithm is decomposed into two parts: detection of unmodeled factors and construction of surrogate variables

##### Detection of unmodeled factors

- Estimate $\hat\mu_i$ and $f_i$ by fitting the model $x_{ij} = \mu_i + f_i(y_i) + e_{ij}$ and get the residual $r_{ij} = x_{ij}-\hat\mu_i - \hat f_i(y_i)$. Then we have the residual matrix R.

- Perform the singular value decompositon(SVD) of the residual matrix $R = UDV^T$

- Let $d_l$ be the $l$th eigenvalue of the diagonal matrix D for $l = 1,...,n$. Set $df$ as the freedom of the model $\hat\mu_i + \hat f_i(y_i)$. We could build a statistic $T_k$ as:

$$T_k = \frac{d_k^2}{\sum_{l=1}^{n-df}d_l^2}$$

to show the variance explained by the $k$th eigenvalue.

- Permute each row of R to remove the structure in the matrix and get $R^*$.

- Fit the model $r_{ij}^* = \mu_i^* + f_i^*(y_i) + e^*_{ij}$ and get $r_{ij}^0 = r^*_{ij}-\hat\mu^*_i - \hat f^*_i(y_i)$ as a null matrix $R_0$

- Perform the singular value decompositon(SVD) of the residual matrix $R_0 = U_0D_0V_0^T$

- Compute the null statistic:

$$
T_k^0 = \frac{d_{0k}^2}{\sum_{l=1}^{n-df}d_{0l}^2}
$$

- Repeat permuting the row B times to get the null statistics $T_k^{0b}$

- Get the p-value for eigengene:

$$p_k = \frac{\#{T_k^{0b}\geq T_k;b=1,...,B }}{B}$$

- For a significance level $\alpha$, treat k as a significant signature of residual R if $p_k\leq\alpha$

##### Construction of surrogate variables

- Estimate $\hat\mu_i$ and $f_i$ by fitting the model $x_{ij} = \mu_i + f_i(y_i) + e_{ij}$ and get the residual $r_{ij} = x_{ij}-\hat\mu_i - \hat f_i(y_i)$. Then we have the residual matrix R.

- Perform the singular value decompositon(SVD) of the residual matrix $R = UDV^T$. Let $e_k = (e_{k1},...,e_{kn})^T$ be the $k$th column of V

- Set $\hat K$ as the significant eigenvalues found by the first step.

- Regress each $e_k$ on $x_i$, get the p-value for the association.

- Set $\pi_0$ as the proportion of the peak intensitity $x_i$ not associate with $e_k$ and find the numbers $\hat m =[1-\hat \pi_0 \times m]$ and the indices of the peaks associated with the eigenvalues

- Form the matrix $\hat m_1 \times N$, this matrix$X_r$ stand for the potiential variables. As was done for R, get the eigengents of $X_r$ and denote these by $e_j^r$

- Let $j^* = argmax_{1\leq j \leq n}cor(e_k,e_j^r)$ and set $\hat h_k=e_j^r$. Set the estimate of the surrogate variable to be the eigenvalue of the reduced matrix most correlated with the corresponding residual eigenvalue. Since the reduced matrix is enriched for peaks associated with this residual eigenvalue, this is a principled choice for the estimated surrogate variable that allows for correlation with the primary variable.

- Employ the $\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \sum_{k = 1}^K \gamma_{ki}\hat h_{kj} + e_{ij}$ as te estimate of the ideal model $\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \sum_{k = 1}^K \gamma_{ki}h_{kj} + e_{ij}$

This method could found the potentical unwanted variables for the data. SVA were introduced by Jeff Leek[@leek2012; @leek2007; @leek2008] and EigenMS package implement SVA with modifications including analysis of data with missing values that are typical in LC-MS experiments[@karpievitch2014a].

#### RUV (Remove Unwanted Variation)

This method's performance is similar to SVA. Instead find surrogate variable from the whole dataset. RUA use control or pool QC to find the unwanted variances and remove them to find the peaks related to experimental design. However, we could also empirically estimate the control peaks by linear mixed model. RUA-random[@livera2015] furthor use linear mixed model to estimate the variances of random error. This method could be used with suitable control, which is commen in metabolomics DoE. 

#### RRmix

RRmix also use a latent factor models correct the data[@jr2017]. This method could be treated as linear mixed model version SVA. No control samples are required and the unwanted variances could be removed by factor analysis. This method might be the best choise to remove the unwanted variables with commen experiment design.
