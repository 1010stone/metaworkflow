# Exprimental design(DoE)

Before you perform any metabolomic studies, a clean and meaningful experimental design is the best start. You need at least two groups: treated group and control group. Also you could treat this group infomation as the one primary variable or primary variables to be explored for certain research purposes.

The numbers of samples in each group should be carefully calculated. Supposing the metaoblites of certain biological process only have a few metabolites, the first goal of the exprimenal design is to find the differences of each metabolite in different group. For each metabolite, such comparision could be treated as one t-test. You need to perform a Power analysis to get the numbers. For example, we have two groups of samples with 10 samples in each group. Then we set the power at 0.9, which means 1 minus Type II error probability, the standard deviation at 1 and the significance level(Type 1 error probability) at 0.05. Then we get the meanful delta between the two groups should be higher than 1.53367 under this experiment design. Also we could set the delta to get the minimized numbers of the samples in each group. To get those data such as the standard deviation or delta for power analysis, you need to perform pre-experiments.

```{r}
power.t.test(n=10,sd=1,sig.level = 0.05,power = 0.9)
power.t.test(delta = 5,sd=1,sig.level = 0.05,power = 0.9)
```


If there are other co-factors, a linear model or randomizing would be applied to eliminated their influences. You need to record the values of those co-factors for further data analysis. Common co-factors in metabolomic studies are age, gender, location, etc.

If you need data correction, some background or calibration samples are required. However, control samples could also be used for data correction in certain DoE.

Another important factors are instrumentals. High-resolution mass spectrum is always preferred. As shown in Lukas's study @najdekr2016: 

> the most effective mass resolving powers for profiling analyses of metabolite rich biofluids on the Orbitrap Elite were around 60000–120000 fwhm to retrieve the highest amount of information. The region between 400–800 m/z was influenced the most by resolution.
