# Exprimental design(DoE)

Before you perform any metabolomic studies, a clean and meaningful experimental design is always the best start. You need two groups at least: treated group and control group. 

If there are other co-factors, a linear model or randomizing would be applied to eliminated their influences. You need to record the values of those co-factors for further data analysis. Common co-factors in metabolomic studies are age, gender, location, etc.

If you need data correction, some background or calibration samples are required. However, control samples could also be used for data correction in certain DoE.
