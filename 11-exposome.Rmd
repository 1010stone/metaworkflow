# Exposome

According to [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/exposome/default.html), The exposome can be defined as the measure of all the exposures of an individual in a lifetime and how those exposures relate to health. Exposomics is the study of the exposome and relies on the application of internal and external exposure assessment methods. 

- Internal exposure relies on fields of study such as genomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, transcriptomics and proteomics.

- External exposure assessment relies on measuring environmental stressors. 

## Internal exposure

- [HMDB](http://www.hmdb.ca/) is a freely available electronic database containing detailed information about small molecule metabolites found in the human body.

- [Lipid Maps](http://www.lipidmaps.org/)

- [GMDB](https://jcggdb.jp/rcmg/glycodb/Ms_ResultSearch) a multistage tandem mass spectral database using a variety of structurally defined glycans.

- [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/compound/) is a collection of small molecules, biopolymers, and other chemical substances that are relevant to biological systems.

- [Virtual Metabolic Human Database](https://www.vmh.life/) integrating human and gut microbiome metabolism with nutrition and disease.

## External exposure

### Environmental fate of compounds

#### QSPR

- [Chemicalize](https://chemicalize.com/) is a powerful online platform for chemical calculations, search, and text processing.

- [QSPR molecular descriptor generate tools list](http://www.moleculardescriptors.eu/resources/resources.htm)

- [Spark](http://www.archemcalc.com/sparc.html) uses computational algorithms based on fundamental chemical structure theory to estimate a wide variety of reactivity parameters strictly from molecular structure.

LogP is important for analytical chemistry. Mannhold [@mannhold2009] report a comprehensive comparison of logP algorithms. Later, [Rajarshi Guha](http://blog.rguha.net/?p=896) make a comparison with logP algorithms with CDK based on logPstar dataset. Commercial software such as Spark, ACS Labs and ChemAxon might always claim a better performance on in-house dataset compared with public software like KowWIN within EPI Suite. However, we should be careful to evaluate the influnce of logP accuracy on the metabolites or unknown compounds.

#### Fate

- [Wania Group](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/labs/wania/downloads/) developed software tools to address various aspects of organic contaminant fate and behaviour. 

- [Trent University](http://www.trentu.ca/academic/aminss/envmodel/models/models.html) release models to predict environmental fate for pollutions such as Level 3.

- [EAWAG-BBD](http://eawag-bbd.ethz.ch/index.html) could provide information on microbial enzyme-catalyzed reactions that are important for biotechnology.

### Exposure study database

- The information system [PANGAEA](https://www.pangaea.de) is operated as an Open Access library aimed at archiving, publishing and distributing georeferenced data from earth system research. 

- [Environmental Health Criteria (EHC) Monographs](http://www.inchem.org/pages/ehc.html)

- [CTD](http://ctdbase.org/) is a robust, publicly available database that aims to advance understanding about how environmental exposures affect human health.

- [ODMOA](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/office-of-data-management-and-outcomes-assessment) facilitates and coordinates the collection, access to, and use of public health data in order to monitor and improve population health. This data is better for general public health research for Massachusetts.

- [The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)](https://seer.cancer.gov/) Program provides information on cancer statistics in an effort to reduce the cancer burden among the U.S. population. 

- [CompTox](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard) compounds, exposure and toxicity database. [Here](https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/downloadable-computational-toxicology-data) is related data.

- [T3DB](http://www.t3db.ca/) is a unique bioinformatics resource that combines detailed toxin data with comprehensive toxin target information.

- [FooDB](http://foodb.ca/) is the worldâ€™s largest and most comprehensive resource on food constituents, chemistry and biology.

- [Phenol explorer](http://phenol-explorer.eu) is the first comprehensive database on polyphenol content in foods.

- [Drugbank](https://www.drugbank.ca/releases/latest) is a unique bioinformatics and cheminformatics resource that combines detailed drug data with comprehensive drug target information.

- [LMDB](http://lmdb.ca) is a freely available electronic database containing detailed information about small molecule metabolites found in different livestock species.
