  abstract = {Background: The gut metabolome may be associated with the incidence and progression of numerous diseases. The composition of the gut metabolome can be captured by measuring metabolite levels in the feces. However, there are little data describing the effect of fecal sample collection methods on metabolomic measures.
Methods: We collected fecal samples from 18 volunteers using four methods: no solution, 95\% ethanol, fecal occult blood test (FOBT) cards, and fecal immunochemical test (FIT). One set of samples was frozen after collection (day 0), and for 95\% ethanol, FOBT, and FIT, a second set was frozen after 96 hours at room temperature. We evaluated (i) technical reproducibility within sample replicates, (ii) stability after 96 hours at room temperature for 95\% ethanol, FOBT, and FIT, and (iii) concordance of metabolite measures with the putative ``gold standard,'' day 0 samples without solution.
Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) estimating technical reproducibility were high for replicate samples for each collection method. ICCs estimating stability at room temperature were high for 95\% ethanol and FOBT (median ICC $>$ 0.87) but not FIT (median ICC = 0.52). Similarly, Spearman correlation coefficients (rs) estimating metabolite concordance with the ``gold standard'' were higher for 95\% ethanol (median rs = 0.82) and FOBT (median rs = 0.70) than for FIT (median rs = 0.40).
Conclusions: Metabolomic measurements appear reproducible and stable in fecal samples collected with 95\% ethanol or FOBT. Concordance with the ``gold standard'' is highest with 95\% ethanol and acceptable with FOBT.
Impact: Future epidemiologic studies should collect feces using 95\% ethanol or FOBT if interested in studying fecal metabolomics. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 25(11); 1483\textendash{}90. \textcopyright{}2016 AACR.},

  abstract = {In recent years, different geometrical configurations of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) have been directly coupled to mass spectrometry, resulting in benefits such as diminishing matrix effects, improvement of detection limits, and considerable enhancement of analysis throughput. Although SPME fibers have been used for years, their potential for quantitative analysis when directly combined with mass spectrometry has not been explored to its full extent. In this study, we present the direct coupling of biocompatible SPME (Bio-SPME) fibers to mass spectrometry via nanoelectrospray ionization (nano-ESI) emitters as a powerful tool for fast quantitative analysis of target analytes in biofluids. Total sample preparation time does not exceed 2 min, and by selecting an appropriate fiber length and sample vessel, sample volumes ranging between 10 and 1500 $\mu$L can be used. Despite the short extraction time of the technique, limits of detection in the subnanogram per milliliter with good accuracy ($\geq$90\%) and linearity (R2 $>$ 0.999) were attained for all the studied probes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), urine, and whole blood. Given that Bio-SPME\textendash{}nano-ESI efficiently integrates sampling with analyte extraction/enrichment, sample cleanup (including elimination of matrix effects in the form of particles), and ionization, our results demonstrated that it is an advantageous configuration for bioanalytical applications such as therapeutic drug monitoring, doping in sports, and pharmacological studies in various matrixes.},

Metabolites were extracted from apple tissues and introduced by thermal desorption into a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography\textendash{}time-of-flight mass spectrometry instrument. The feasibility of this sampling approach, based on exploitation of microextraction principles, including negligible depletion of free analyte concentrations, solventless sampling and sample preparation, and on-site compatibility, was determined in global metabolite analysis. Rather than adopting an approach of traditional sample preparation, requiring metabolism quenching and laborious sample preparation, the objective of the study was to capture the metabolome in vivo, evaluate the feasibility of the approach to provide unbiased extraction coverage, and compare analytical precision when different SPME sampling modes are employed. The potential of in vivo DI-SPME in quantitative plant metabolomics was assessed by evaluating changes in metabolic fingerprints in response to fruit maturation. The in vivo SPME sampling approach has been demonstrated as capable of sampling living systems with high reproducibility, considering that nearly 50\% of hundreds of evaluated compounds included in the determination of analytical performance met the 15\% RSD FDA criterion. Esters were extracted with high repeatability (\% RSD for hexyl butanoate and butyl butanoate of 16.5 and 5.9, respectively, from 9 determinations in 3 apples) and found to be upregulated in response to apple fruit maturation.},

  abstract = {Metabolomic data are frequently acquired using chromatographically coupled mass spectrometry (MS) platforms. For such datasets, the first step in data analysis relies on feature detection, where a feature is defined by a mass and retention time. While a feature typically is derived from a single compound, a spectrum of mass signals is more a more-accurate representation of the mass spectrometric signal for a given metabolite. Here, we report a novel feature grouping method that operates in an unsupervised manner to group signals from MS data into spectra without relying on predictability of the in-source phenomenon. We additionally address a fundamental bottleneck in metabolomics, annotation of MS level signals, by incorporating indiscriminant MS/MS (idMS/MS) data implicitly: feature detection is performed on both MS and idMS/MS data, and feature\textendash{}feature relationships are determined simultaneously from the MS and idMS/MS data. This approach facilitates identification of metabolites using in-source MS and/or idMS/MS spectra from a single experiment, reduces quantitative analytical variation compared to single-feature measures, and decreases false positive annotations of unpredictable phenomenon as novel compounds. This tool is released as a freely available R package, called RAMClustR, and is sufficiently versatile to group features from any chromatographic-spectrometric platform or feature-finding software.},

Recently, with the development of rapid scanning high-resolution high accuracy mass spectrometers and the desire for high throughput screening, minimal or no chromatographic separation has become increasingly popular. When analyzing complex cellular extracts, however, the lack of chromatographic separation could potentially result in misannotation of structurally related metabolites. Here, we show that, even using electrospray ionization, a soft ionization method, in-source fragmentation generates unwanted byproducts of identical mass to common metabolites. For example, nucleotide-triphosphates generate nucleotide-diphosphates, and hexose-phosphates generate triose-phosphates. We evaluated yeast intracellular metabolite extracts and found more than 20 cases of in-source fragments that mimic common metabolites. Accordingly, chromatographic separation is required for accurate quantitation of many common cellular metabolites.},

Accordingly, a metabolomics study based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was employed to elucidate the molecular developmental toxicology of H-BPA using the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigmas) embryo model. Here, we revealed decreased synthesis of nucleosides, amino acids and lipids, and disruptions in the TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle, glycolysis and lipid metabolism, thus inhibiting the developmental processes of embryos exposed to H-BPA. Unexpectedly, we observed enhanced neural activity accompanied by lactate accumulation and accelerated heart rates due to an increase in dopamine pathway and a decrease in inhibitory neurotransmitters following H-BPA exposure. Notably, disorders of the neural system, and disruptions in glycolysis, the TCA cycle, nucleoside metabolism, lipid metabolism, glutamate and aspartate metabolism induced by H-BPA exposure were heritable. Furthermore, lactate and dopa were identified as potential biomarkers of the developmental toxicity of H-BPA and related genetic effects.

  abstract = {Determination of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) often is considered to be a challenging undertaking owing to secondary interactions of the analytes' permanently charged quaternary ammonium head or hydrophobic tail with the utilized labware. Here, for the first time, a micelle assisted thin-film solid phase microextraction (TF-SPME) using a zwitterionic detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) as a matrix modifier is introduced as a novel approach for in-laboratory sample preparation of the challenging compounds. The proposed micelle assisted TF-SPME method offers suppression/enhancement free electrospray ionization of analytes in mass spectrometric detection, minimal interaction of the micelles with the TF-SPME coating, and chromatographic stationary phase and analysis free of secondary interactions. Moreover, it was found that the matrix modifier has multiple functions; when its concentration is found below the critical micelle concentration (CMC), the matrix modifier primarily acts as a surface deactivator; above its CMC, it acts as a stabilizer for QACs. Additionally, shorter equilibrium extraction times in the presence of the modifier demonstrated that micelles also assist in the transfer of analytes from the bulk of the sample to the surface of the coating. The developed micelle assisted TF-SPME protocol using the 96-blade system requires only 30 min of extraction and 15 min of desorption. Together with a conditioning step (15 min), the entire method is 60 min; considering the advantage of using the 96-blade system, if all the blades in the brush are used, the sample preparation time per sample is 0.63 min. Moreover, the recoveries for all analytes with the developed method were found to range within 80.2\textendash{}97.3\%; as such, this method can be considered an open bed solid phase extraction. The proposed method was successfully validated using real samples.},

Combinations of multiple batches or data sets in large cross-sectional epidemiology studies are frequently utilized in metabolomics, but various systematic biases can introduce both batch and injection order effects and often require proper calibrations prior to chemometric analyses. We present a novel algorithm, Batch Normalizer, to calibrate large scale metabolomic data. Batch Normalizer utilizes a regression model with consideration of the total abundance of each sample to improve its calibration performance, and it is able to remove both batch effect and injection order effects. This calibration method was tested using liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/TOF-MS) chromatograms of 228 plasma samples and 23 pooled quality control (QC) samples. We evaluated the performance of Batch Normalizer by examining the distribution of relative standard deviation (RSD) for all peaks detected in the pooled QC samples, the average Pearson correlation coefficients for all peaks between any two of QC samples, and the distribution of QC samples in the scores plot of a principal component analysis (PCA). After calibration by Batch Normalizer, the number of peaks in QC samples with RSD less than 15\% increased from 11 to 914, all of the QC samples were closely clustered in PCA scores plot, and the average Pearson correlation coefficients for all peaks of QC samples increased from 0.938 to 0.976. This method was compared to 7 commonly used calibration methods. We discovered that using Batch Normalizer to calibrate LC/TOF-MS data produces the best calibration results.},

  abstract = {It is vital to pay much attention to the design of extraction methods developed for plant metabolomics, as any non-extracted or converted metabolites will greatly affect the overall quality of the metabolomics study. Method validation is however often omitted in plant metabolome studies, as the well-established methodologies for classical targeted analyses such as recovery optimization cannot be strictly applied. The aim of the present study is to thoroughly evaluate state-of-the-art comprehensive extraction protocols for plant metabolomics with liquid chromatography-photodiode array-accurate mass mass spectrometry (LC-PDA-amMS) by bridging the gap with method validation.

Validation of an extraction protocol in untargeted plant metabolomics should ideally be accomplished by validating the protocol for all possible outcomes, i.e. for all secondary metabolites potentially present in the plant. In an effort to approach this ideal validation scenario, two plant matrices were selected based on their wide versatility of phytochemicals: meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) for its polyphenols content, and spicy paprika powder (from the genus Capsicum) for its apolar phytochemicals content (carotenoids, phytosterols, capsaicinoids). These matrices were extracted with comprehensive extraction protocols adapted from literature and analysed with a generic LC-PDA-amMS characterization platform that was previously validated for broad range phytochemical analysis. The performance of the comprehensive sample preparation protocols was assessed based on extraction efficiency, repeatability and intermediate precision and on ionization suppression/enhancement evaluation.

The manuscript elaborates on the finding that none of the extraction methods allowed to exhaustively extract the metabolites. Furthermore, it is shown that depending on the extraction conditions enzymatic degradation mechanisms can occur. Investigation of the fractions obtained with the different extraction methods revealed a low resolving power for phytochemicals for all methods. Nevertheless, an overall good repeatability was observed for all extraction methods, which is essential to allow direct comparison between samples. In summary, no single procedure outperforms the others and compromises will have to be made during method selection.},

We show theoretically that conditioning on a dependence kernel is sufficient to render statistical tests independent regardless of the level of dependence in the observed data.

  abstract = {Although anticancer drug resistance has been linked to high expression of P-glycoprotein and the enhanced DNA repair ability, the biochemical process and the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance are not clear. In order to clarify the biochemical mechanisms of drug resistance during anticancer drug treatment, we studied the metabolomics of MCF-7/S and MCF-7/Adr cell lines, the COC1 and COC1/DDP cell lines, including the metabolic pathways of multidrug-resistant tumor cells and the changes of endogenous substances in cells. The intracellular metabolites were profiled using ultra-performance liquid chromatography\textendash{}tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC\textendash{}MS/MS). In this study, 24 biomarkers in MCF-7/Adr cells and 15 biomarkers in COC1/DDP cells that are involved in some important metabolic pathways were putatively identified. Several metabolic pathways are changed in tumor cells showing drug resistance, such as protein synthesis pathways, cysteine synthesis, the glutamine metabolic pathway, and the ammonia cycle; the first of these are involved in the synthesis of some important proteins including membrane proteins, multidrug resistance-associated proteins, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Proteins related to drug resistance were overexpressed in multidrug-resistant tumor cells. These proteins depended on energy and play important roles in the emergence of drug resistance. The changes in glutathione and cysteine metabolic pathways showed that the cells can activate related metabolic pathways and reduce the cell apoptosis when they encounter oxidative damage. These findings indicate that drug resistance is likely associated with increased P-gp synthesis and reduced apoptosis of tumor cells.Graphical AbstractDrug resistance was charactered in the changing of genomics and proteomics. Like enhancing DNA repair, reducing uptake, high P-g protein expression. Here, we studied the changes of metabolite pathway which could be also play an imported role in drug resistance},

However, while ESI is a soft ionization technique, in-source phenomena including multimerization, nonproton cation adduction, and in-source fragmentation complicate interpretation of MS data. Here, we report chromatographic and mass spectrometric behavior of 904 authentic standards collected under conditions identical to a typical nontargeted profiling experiment. The data illustrate that the often high level of complexity in MS spectra is likely to result in misinterpretation during the annotation phase of the experiment and a large overestimation of the number of compounds detected. However, our analysis of this MS spectral library data indicates that in-source phenomena are not random but depend at least in part on chemical structure. These nonrandom patterns enabled predictions to be made as to which in-source signals are likely to be observed for a given compound. Using the authentic standard spectra as a training set, we modeled the in-source phenomena for all compounds in the Human Metabolome Database to generate a theoretical in-source spectrum and retention time library. A novel spectral similarity matching platform was developed to facilitate efficient spectral searching for nontargeted profiling applications. Taken together, this collection of experimental spectral data, predictive modeling, and informatic tools enables more efficient, reliable, and transparent metabolite annotation.},

In our study we observed that two thirds of the rats (24/36) died at a given dose of LPS, while the rest (12/36) survived. Tracking the dynamic metabolic change in survival and non-survival rats in the early stage may reveal new system information to understand the inter-individual variation in response to LPS. As the time-resolved datasets are very complex and no single method can elucidate the problem clearly and comprehensively, the static and dynamic metabolomics methods were employed in combination as cross-validation. Intriguingly, some common results have been observed. Lipids were the main different metabolites between survival and non-survival rats in pre-dose serum and in the early stage of infection with LPS. The LPS treatment led to S-adenosly-methionine and total cysteine individual difference in early stage, and subsequent significant perturbations in energy metabolism and oxidative stress. Furthermore, cytokine profiles were analyzed to identify potential biological associations between cytokines and specific metabolites. Our collective findings may provide some heuristic guidance for elucidating the underlying mechanism of individual difference in LPS-mediated disease.},

The plasma sample was obtained from orbital venous of rats after oral administration and pretreated by protein precipitation before analysis. All sample data from total ion chromatograms (TICs) of LC-TOF/MS were aligned and peak picked by XCMS and MetAlign combined to extract three-dimensional datasets (peak code, tR\textendash{}m/z pairs and ion intensity). Xenobiotics in rat plasma were differentiated from endogenous components by multivariate statistical analysis and then divided into prototype compounds and metabolites by comparing tR\textendash{}m/z with the chemical compounds of ZZHPD. Combined with fragment ions and structure information of LC-TSQ/MS, a total of 61 compounds, including 35 prototype compounds and 26 metabolites, were rapidly identified or tentatively characterized in rat plasma. Results indicated that iridoid glycosides, monoterpenoids, flavonoids, and lignans were the main absorbed chemical components of ZZHPD. Glucuronidation and sulfation were the main metabolic pathways of ZZHPD compounds in vivo. In addition, there were ring-opening reactions and reduction reactions for iridoid glycosides, hydrolysis for flavonoids, as well as hydroxylation and stereoscopic conversion reactions for lignans. This study offers a systematically applicable approach for rapid screening and identification of xenobiotics and metabolites derived from multi-herb prescription in vivo, and provides useful information for ascertaining bioactive ingredients and action mechanisms of ZZHPD.Graphical AbstractDiagram of untargeted metabolomics-driven strategy for ZZHPD in rat plasma},

Several artefacts have been identified during the acquisition step in large LC/MS metabolomics experiments, including ion suppression, carryover or changes in the sensitivity and intensity. Several sources have been pointed out as responsible for these effects. In this context, the drift effects of the peak intensity is one of the most frequent and may even constitute the main source of variance in the data, resulting in misleading statistical results when the samples are analysed. In this article, we propose the introduction of a methodology based on a common variance analysis before the data normalization to address this issue. This methodology was tested and compared with four other methods by calculating the Dunn and Silhouette indices of the quality control classes. The results showed that our proposed methodology performed better than any of the other four methods. As far as we know, this is the first time that this kind of approach has been applied in the metabolomics context.

However, the metabolism of chemicals within an organism is extremely complex. Therefore, the identification of metabolites is often difficult and laborious. Several untargeted metabolomics methods have been developed to perform objective searching/filtering of accurate-mass-based LC-MS data to facilitate metabolite identification. In this study, three metabolomics data processing approaches were used for chemical exposure marker discovery in urine with an LTQ-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) dataset; di-isononyl phthalate (DINP) was used as an example. The data processing techniques included the SMAIT, mass defect filtering (MDF), and XCMS Online. Sixteen, 83, and 139 probable DINP metabolite signals were obtained using the SMAIT, MDF, and XCMS procedures, respectively. Fourteen probable metabolite signals mined simultaneously by the three metabolomics approaches were confirmed as DINP metabolites by structural information provided by LC-MS/MS. Among them, 13 probable metabolite signals were validated as exposure-related markers in a rat model. Six (m/z 319.155, 361.127, 373.126, 389.157, 437.112 and 443.130) of the 13 exposure-related DINP metabolite signals have not previously been reported in the literature. Our data indicate that SMAIT provided an efficient method to discover effectively and systematically urinary exposure markers of toxicant. The DINP metabolism information can provide valuable information for further investigations of DINP toxicity, toxicokinetics, exposure assessment, and human health effects.},

  abstract = {Bariatric surgery is currently one of the most effective treatments for obesity and leads to significant weight reduction, improved cardiovascular risk factors and overall survival in treated patients. To date, most studies focused on short-term effects of bariatric surgery on the metabolic profile and found high variation in the individual responses to surgery. The aim of this study was to identify relevant metabolic changes not only shortly after bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) but also up to one year after the intervention by using untargeted metabolomics. 132 serum samples taken from 44 patients before surgery, after hospital discharge (1\textendash{}3 weeks after surgery) and at a 1-year follow-up during a prospective study (NCT01271062) performed at two study centers (Austria and Switzerland). The samples included 24 patients with type 2 diabetes at baseline, thereof 9 with diabetes remission after one year. The samples were analyzed by using liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS, HILIC-QExactive). Raw data was processed with XCMS and drift-corrected through quantile regression based on quality controls. 177 relevant metabolic features were selected through Random Forests and univariate testing and 36 metabolites were identified. Identified metabolites included trimethylamine- N -oxide, alanine, phenylalanine and indoxyl-sulfate which are known markers for cardiovascular risk. In addition we found a significant decrease in alanine after one year in the group of patients with diabetes remission relative to non-remission. Our analysis highlights the importance of assessing multiple points in time in subjects undergoing bariatric surgery to enable the identification of biomarkers for treatment response, cardiovascular benefit and diabetes remission. Key-findings include different trend pattern over time for various metabolites and demonstrated that short term changes should not necessarily be used to identify important long term effects of bariatric surgery.},

Therefore, of fundamental interest for every enzyme is the elucidation of its natural substrates. Here, we describe a general strategy for identifying endogenous substrates of enzymes by untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of tissue metabolomes from wild-type and enzyme-inactivated organisms. We use this method to discover several brain lipids regulated by the mammalian enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in vivo, including known signaling molecules (e.g., the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide) and a novel family of nervous system-enriched natural products, the taurine-conjugated fatty acids. Remarkably, the relative hydrolytic activity that FAAH exhibited for lipid metabolites in vitro was not predictive of the identity of specific FAAH substrates in vivo. Thus, global metabolite profiling establishes unanticipated connections between the proteome and metabolome that enable assignment of an enzyme's unique biochemical functions in vivo.},

  abstract = {Accurate predictions on the bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are critical for hazard and ecosystem health assessments. Aquatic systems are influenced by multiple stressors including climate change and species invasions and it is important to be able to predict variability in POP concentrations in changing environments. Current steady state bioaccumulation models simplify POP bioaccumulation dynamics, assuming that pollutant uptake and elimination processes become balanced over an organism's lifespan. These models do not consider the complexity of dynamic variables such as temperature and growth rates which are known to have the potential to regulate bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms. We contrast a steady state (SS) bioaccumulation model with a dynamic nonsteady state (NSS) model and a no elimination (NE) model. We demonstrate that both the NSS and the NE models are superior at predicting both average concentrations as well as variation in POPs among individuals. This comparison demonstrates that temporal drivers, such as environmental fluctuations in temperature, growth dynamics, and modified food-web structure strongly determine contaminant concentrations and variability in a changing environment. These results support the recommendation of the future development of more dynamic, nonsteady state bioaccumulation models to predict hazard and risk assessments in the Anthropocene.},

Since the development of metabolomics, the change of metabolite profiles caused by cyclophosphamide has been studied by metabolomics and has gained much attention. In this study, we analyzed rat plasma samples collected one, three and five days after cyclophosphamide administration using ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS). Multiple statistical analyses, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares ⿿ discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), were used to examine metabolite profile changes in plasma samples in order to screen for potential cardiotoxicity biomarkers and metabolic pathways. Levels of a dozen of metabolites changed significantly in plasma from the CY-treated group after one, three, and five days compared with the control group treated with normal saline (NS). Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis suggested that the total 16 metabolites play important roles in different times of CY-induced cardiotoxicity respectively. Our results suggest that these metabolites in linoleic acid metabolism and glycerol phospholipid metabolism may be related to CY-induced cardiotoxicity. These metabolites could act as sensitive biomarkers for CY-induced cardiotoxicity and be useful for investigating toxic mechanisms. They may also lay a foundation for clinical use of cyclophosphamide.},

  abstract = {Liquid chromatography (LC) with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) represents a powerful technique for the identification and/or confirmation of small molecules, i.e. drugs, metabolites or contaminants, in different matrices. However, reliability of analyte identification by HRMS is being challenged by the uncertainty that affects the exact mass measurement. This parameter, characterized by accuracy and precision, is influenced by sample matrix and interferent compounds so that questions about how to develop and validate reliable LC-HRMS-based methods are being raised. Experimental approaches for studying the effects of various key factors influencing mass accuracy on low-molecular weight compounds (MW $<$ 150 Da) when using a quadrupole-time-of-flight (QTOF) mass analyzer were described. Biogenic amines in human plasma were considered for the purpose and the effects of peak shape, ion abundance, resolution and data processing on accurate mass measurements of the analytes were evaluated. In addition, the influence of the matrix on the uncertainty associated with their identification and quantitation is discussed. A critical evaluation on the calculation of the limits of detection was carried out, considering the uncertainty associated with exact mass measurement of HRMS-based methods. The minimum concentration level of the analytes that was able to provide a statistical error lower than 5 ppm in terms of precision was 10 times higher than those calculated with S/N = 3, thus suggesting the importance of considering both components of exact mass measurement uncertainty in the evaluation of the limit of detection.

Despite the increased accuracy from the original version to version 2.0 in terms of extracting metabolite information for identification and quantitation, ADAP-GC 2.0 requires appropriate specification of a number of parameters and has difficulty in extracting information on compounds that are in low concentration. To overcome these two limitations, ADAP-GC 3.0 was developed to improve both the robustness and sensitivity of compound detection. In this paper, we report how these goals were achieved and compare ADAP-GC 3.0 against three other software tools including ChromaTOF, AnalyzerPro, and AMDIS that are widely used in the metabolomics community.},

The biological and toxicological characteristics of enantiomers of chiral PCBs may differ, but these enantioselective effects of PCBs have not been fully characterized. In this study, we performed metabolomics analysis, using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) to investigate the enantioselective toxic effects of PCB95 in zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) embryos after exposure to three dose levels of 0.1, 1, and 10 $\mu$g/L for 72 h. Multivariate analysis directly reflected the metabolic perturbations caused by PCB95. The effects of (-)-PCB95 and (+)-PCB95 were more prominent than those of the racemate in zebrafish embryos. A total of 26 endogenous metabolites were selected as potential marker metabolites with variable importance at projection values larger than 1 and significant differences ( p \&lt;0.05). These metabolites included amino acids, organic acids, nucleosides, betaine, and choline. The changes in these biomarkers were dependent on the enantiomer-specific structures of PCB95. Fifteen metabolic pathways were significantly affected, and several nervous and immune system-related metabolites were significantly validated after exposure. These metabolic changes indicated that the toxic effects of PCB95 may be associated with the interaction of PCB95 with the nervous and immune systems, thus resulting in disruption of energy metabolism and liver function.},

In any given study there will be many other variables at play, such as the effects of age and sex on the disease. We show that in studies where the expression levels of thousands of genes are measured at once, these issues become surprisingly critical. Due to the complexity of our genomes, environment, and demographic features, there are many sources of variation when analyzing gene expression levels. In any given study, it is impossible to measure every single variable that may be influencing how our genes are expressed. Despite this, we show that by considering all expression levels simultaneously, one can actually recover the effects of these important missed variables and essentially produce an analysis as if all relevant variables were included. As opposed to traditional studies, the massive amount of data available in this setting is what makes the method, called surrogate variable analysis, possible. We hypothesize that surrogate variable analysis will be useful in many large-scale gene expression studies.},

According to the traditional Chinese medicine theory, processing can reduce the toxicity of the herbs. Here, we aim to determine if processing reduces the toxicity of raw PR, and to explore the underlying mechanisms of raw PR-induced toxicities and the toxicity-reducing effect of processing. Biochemical and histopathological approaches were used to evaluate the toxicities of raw and processed PR. Rat serum metabolites were analyzed by LC-TOF-MS. Ingenuity pathway analysis of the metabolomics data highlighted the biological pathways and network functions involved in raw PR-induced toxicities and the toxicity-reducing effect of processing, which were verified by molecular approaches. Results showed that raw PR caused cardiotoxicity, and processing reduced the toxicity. Inhibition of mTOR signaling and activation of the TGF-$\beta$ pathway contributed to raw PR-induced cardiotoxicity, and free radical scavenging might be responsible for the toxicity-reducing effect of processing. Our data shed new light on the mechanisms of raw PR-induced cardiotoxicity and the toxicity-reducing effect of processing. This study provides scientific justifications for the traditional processing theory of PR, and should help in optimizing the processing protocol and clinical combinational application of PR.},

  abstract = {Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS) has been a long-standing approach used for identifying small molecules due to the highly reproducible ionization process of electron impact ionization (EI). However, the use of GC-EI MS in untargeted metabolomics produces large and complex data sets characterized by coeluting compounds and extensive fragmentation of molecular ions caused by the hard electron ionization. In order to identify and extract quantitative information on metabolites across multiple biological samples, integrated computational workflows for data processing are needed. Here we introduce eRah, a free computational tool written in the open language R composed of five core functions: (i) noise filtering and baseline removal of GC/MS chromatograms, (ii) an innovative compound deconvolution process using multivariate analysis techniques based on compound match by local covariance (CMLC) and orthogonal signal deconvolution (OSD), (iii) alignment of mass spectra across samples, (iv) missing compound recovery, and (v) identification of metabolites by spectral library matching using publicly available mass spectra. eRah outputs a table with compound names, matching scores and the integrated area of compounds for each sample. The automated capabilities of eRah are demonstrated by the analysis of GC-time-of-flight (TOF) MS data from plasma samples of adolescents with hyperinsulinaemic androgen excess and healthy controls. The quantitative results of eRah are compared to centWave, the peak-picking algorithm implemented in the widely used XCMS package, MetAlign, and ChromaTOF software. Significantly dysregulated metabolites are further validated using pure standards and targeted analysis by GC-triple quadrupole (QqQ) MS, LC-QqQ, and NMR. eRah is freely available at http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=erah.},

Our work evaluated the feasibility of employing urine metabolomics for the diagnosis and staging of ESCC. The satisfactory classification between the healthy controls and ESCC patients was obtained using the MVDA model, and obvious classification of early-stage and advanced-stage patients was also observed. The results suggest that the combination of LC-MS analysis and MVDA may have potential applications for ESCC diagnosis and staging. We then conducted LC-MS/MS experiments to identify the potential biomarkers with large contributions to the discrimination. A total of 83 potential diagnostic biomarkers for ESCC were screened out, and 19 potential biomarkers were identified; the variations between the differences in staging using these potential biomarkers were further analyzed. These biomarkers may not be unique to ESCCs, but instead result from any malignant disease. To further elucidate the pathophysiology of ESCC, we studied related metabolic pathways and found that ESCC is associated with perturbations of fatty acid $\beta$-oxidation and the metabolism of amino acids, purines, and pyrimidines.},

Thus, we applied a metabolomics approach to analyze urinary metabolites in three groups of participants: patients with polysomnography (PSG)-confirmed OSA, simple snorers (SS), and normal subjects. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry were used. A total of 21 and 31 metabolites were differentially expressed in the SS and OSA groups, respectively. Patients with OSA had 18 metabolites different from those with SS. Of the 56 metabolites detected among the 3 groups, 24 were consistently higher or lower. A receiver operator curve analysis revealed that the combination of 4-hydroxypentenoic acid, arabinose, glycochenodeoxycholate-3-sulfate, isoleucine, serine, and xanthine produced a moderate diagnostic score with a sensitivity (specificity) of 75\% (78\%) for distinguishing OSA from those without OSA. The combination of 4-hydroxypentenoic acid, 5-dihydrotestosterone sulfate, serine, spermine, and xanthine distinguished OSA from SS with a sensitivity of 85\% and specificity of 80\%. Multiple metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with SS and OSA were identified using the metabolomics approach, and the altered metabolite signatures could potentially serve as an alternative diagnostic method to PSG.},

With continuing advances in metabolomics along with constant user feedback, it became clear that a substantial upgrade to the original server was necessary. MetaboAnalyst 2.0, which is the successor to MetaboAnalyst, represents just such an upgrade. MetaboAnalyst 2.0 now contains dozens of new features and functions including new procedures for data filtering, data editing and data normalization. It also supports multi-group data analysis, two-factor analysis as well as time-series data analysis. These new functions have also been supplemented with: (i) a quality-control module that allows users to evaluate their data quality before conducting any analysis, (ii) a functional enrichment analysis module that allows users to identify biologically meaningful patterns using metabolite set enrichment analysis and (iii) a metabolic pathway analysis module that allows users to perform pathway analysis and visualization for 15 different model organisms. In developing MetaboAnalyst 2.0 we have also substantially improved its graphical presentation tools. All images are now generated using anti-aliasing and are available over a range of resolutions, sizes and formats (PNG, TIFF, PDF, PostScript, or SVG). To improve its performance, MetaboAnalyst 2.0 is now hosted on a much more powerful server with substantially modified code to take advantage the server's multi-core CPUs for computationally intensive tasks. MetaboAnalyst 2.0 also maintains a collection of 50 or more FAQs and more than a dozen tutorials compiled from user queries and requests. A downloadable version of MetaboAnalyst 2.0, along detailed instructions for local installation is now available as well.},

  abstract = {Oxidised lipids, covering enzymatic and auto-oxidation-synthesised mediators, are important signalling metabolites in inflammation while also providing a readout for oxidative stress, both of which are prominent physiological processes in a plethora of diseases. Excretion of these metabolites via urine is enhanced through the phase-II conjugation with glucuronic acid, resulting in increased hydrophilicity of these lipid mediators. Here, we developed a bovine liver-$\beta$-glucuronidase hydrolysing sample preparation method, using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry to analyse the total urinary oxidised lipid profile including the prostaglandins, isoprostanes, dihydroxy-fatty acids, hydroxy-fatty acids and the nitro-fatty acids. Our method detected more than 70 oxidised lipids biosynthesised from two non-enzymatic and three enzymatic pathways in urine samples. The total oxidised lipid profiling method was developed and validated for human urine and was demonstrated for urine samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Pro-inflammatory mediators PGF2$\alpha$ and PGF3$\alpha$ and oxidative stress markers iPF2$\alpha$- IV, 11-HETE and 14-HDoHE were positively associated with improvement of disease activity score. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory nitro-fatty acids were negatively associated with baseline disease activity. In conclusion, the developed methodology expands the current metabolic profiling of oxidised lipids in urine, and its application will enhance our understanding of the role these bioactive metabolites play in health and disease.},

Cultures maintained the capacity to produce E. lysistemon flavonoid subclasses with pterocarpans amounting for the most abundant ones suggesting that it could provide a resource of such flavonoid subclass.

Methyl jasmonate (MeJA), phytohormone, was further supplied to culture with the aim of increasing secondary metabolites production and with metabolite profiles subjected to multivariate data analysis to evaluate its effect. Results revealed that triterpene i.e. oleanolic acid and fatty acid i.e. hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid were elicited in response to methyl jasmonate, whereas pterocarpans i.e., isoneorautenol showed a decline in response to elicitation suggesting for the induction of terpenoid biosynthetic pathway and concurrent with a down regulation of pterocarpans.

  issn = {1471-2172},
  doi = {10.1186/1471-2172-9-59},
  abstract = {Background
The statistical analysis of immunological data may be complicated because precise quantitative levels cannot always be determined. Values below a given detection limit may not be observed (nondetects), and data with nondetects are called left-censored. Since nondetects cannot be considered as missing at random, a statistician faced with data containing these nondetects must decide how to combine nondetects with detects. Till now, the common practice is to impute each nondetect with a single value such as a half of the detection limit, and to conduct ordinary regression analysis. The first aim of this paper is to give an overview of methods to analyze, and to provide new methods handling censored data other than an (ordinary) linear regression. The second aim is to compare these methods by simulation studies based on real data.

Results
We compared six new and existing methods: deletion of nondetects, single substitution, extrapolation by regression on order statistics, multiple imputation using maximum likelihood estimation, tobit regression, and logistic regression. The deletion and extrapolation by regression on order statistics methods gave biased parameter estimates. The single substitution method underestimated variances, and logistic regression suffered loss of power. Based on simulation studies, we found that tobit regression performed well when the proportion of nondetects was less than 30\%, and that taken together the multiple imputation method performed best.

Conclusion
Based on simulation studies, the newly developed multiple imputation method performed consistently well under different scenarios of various proportion of nondetects, sample sizes and even in the presence of heteroscedastic errors.},

Upstream biological disruptions result in a series of metabolomic changes and, as such, the metabolome holds a wealth of information that is thought to be most predictive of phenotype. Uncovering this knowledge is a work in progress. The field of metabolomics is still maturing; the community has leveraged proteomics experience when applicable and developed a range of sample preparation and instrument methodology along with myriad data processing and analysis approaches. Research focuses have now shifted toward a fundamental understanding of the biology responsible for metabolomic changes. There are several types of metabolomics experiments including both targeted and untargeted analyses. While untargeted, hypothesis generating workflows exhibit many valuable attributes, challenges inherent to the approach remain. This Critical Insight comments on these challenges, focusing on the identification process of LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics studies\textemdash{}specifically in mammalian systems. Biological interpretation of metabolomics data hinges on the ability to accurately identify metabolites. The range of confidence associated with identifications that is often overlooked is reviewed, and opportunities for advancing the metabolomics field are described.Graphical Abstractᅟ},

Accordingly, a metabolomics study based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was employed to elucidate the molecular developmental toxicology of H-BPA using the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigmas) embryo model. Here, we revealed decreased synthesis of nucleosides, amino acids and lipids, and disruptions in the TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle, glycolysis and lipid metabolism, thus inhibiting the developmental processes of embryos exposed to H-BPA. Unexpectedly, we observed enhanced neural activity accompanied by lactate accumulation and accelerated heart rates due to an increase in dopamine pathway and a decrease in inhibitory neurotransmitters following H-BPA exposure. Notably, disorders of the neural system, and disruptions in glycolysis, the TCA cycle, nucleoside metabolism, lipid metabolism, glutamate and aspartate metabolism induced by H-BPA exposure were heritable.

  abstract = {Septic shock is the most severe form of sepsis, which is still one of the leading causes of death in the intensive care unit (ICU). Even though early prognosis and diagnosis are known to be indispensable for reaching an optimistic outcome, pathogenic complexities and the lack of specific treatment make it difficult to predict the outcome individually. In the present study, serum samples from surviving and non-surviving septic shock patients were drawn before clinical intervention at admission. Metabolic profiles of all the samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. One thousand four hundred nineteen peaks in positive mode and 1878 peaks in negative mode were retained with their relative standard deviation (RSD) below 30 \%, in which 187 metabolites were initially identified by retention time and database in the light of the exact molecular mass. Differences between samples from the survivors and the non-survivors were investigated using multivariate and univariate analysis. Finally, 43 significantly varied metabolites were found in the comparison between survivors and non-survivors. Concretely, metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, amino acids, and several energy metabolism-related metabolites were up-regulated in the non-survivors, whereas those in the urea cycle and fatty acids were generally down-regulated. Metabolites such as lysine, alanine, and methionine did not present significant changes in the comparison. Six metabolites were further defined as primary discriminators differentiating the survivors from the non-survivors at the early stage of septic shock. Our findings reveal that LC-MS-based metabolomics is a useful tool for studying septic shock.Graphical abstractᅟ},

  abstract = {IntroductionBatch effects in large untargeted metabolomics experiments are almost unavoidable, especially when sensitive detection techniques like mass spectrometry (MS) are employed. In order to obtain peak intensities that are comparable across all batches, corrections need to be performed. Since non-detects, i.e., signals with an intensity too low to be detected with certainty, are common in metabolomics studies, the batch correction methods need to take these into account. ObjectivesThis paper aims to compare several batch correction methods, and investigates the effect of different strategies for handling non-detects.MethodsBatch correction methods usually consist of regression models, possibly also accounting for trends within batches. To fit these models quality control samples (QCs), injected at regular intervals, can be used. Also study samples can be used, provided that the injection order is properly randomized. Normalization methods, not using information on batch labels or injection order, can correct for batch effects as well. Introducing two easy-to-use quality criteria, we assess the merits of these batch correction strategies using three large LC\textendash{}MS and GC\textendash{}MS data sets of samples from Arabidopsis thaliana.ResultsThe three data sets have very different characteristics, leading to clearly distinct behaviour of the batch correction strategies studied. Explicit inclusion of information on batch and injection order in general leads to very good corrections; when enough QCs are available, also general normalization approaches perform well. Several approaches are shown to be able to handle non-detects\textemdash{}replacing them with very small numbers such as zero seems the worst of the approaches considered.ConclusionThe use of quality control samples for batch correction leads to good results when enough QCs are available. If an experiment is properly set up, batch correction using the study samples usually leads to a similar high-quality correction, but has the advantage that more metabolites are corrected. The strategy for handling non-detects is important: choosing small values like zero can lead to suboptimal batch corrections.},

  abstract = {Metabolomics is a newly emerging field of `omics' research that is concerned with characterizing large numbers of metabolites using NMR, chromatography and mass spectrometry. It is frequently used in biomarker identification and the metabolic profiling of cells, tissues or organisms. The data processing challenges in metabolomics are quite unique and often require specialized (or expensive) data analysis software and a detailed knowledge of cheminformatics, bioinformatics and statistics. In an effort to simplify metabolomic data analysis while at the same time improving user accessibility, we have developed a freely accessible, easy-to-use web server for metabolomic data analysis called MetaboAnalyst. Fundamentally, MetaboAnalyst is a web-based metabolomic data processing tool not unlike many of today's web-based microarray analysis packages. It accepts a variety of input data (NMR peak lists, binned spectra, MS peak lists, compound/concentration data) in a wide variety of formats. It also offers a number of options for metabolomic data processing, data normalization, multivariate statistical analysis, graphing, metabolite identification and pathway mapping. In particular, MetaboAnalyst supports such techniques as: fold change analysis, t-tests, PCA, PLS-DA, hierarchical clustering and a number of more sophisticated statistical or machine learning methods. It also employs a large library of reference spectra to facilitate compound identification from most kinds of input spectra. MetaboAnalyst guides users through a step-by-step analysis pipeline using a variety of menus, information hyperlinks and check boxes. Upon completion, the server generates a detailed report describing each method used, embedded with graphical and tabular outputs. MetaboAnalyst is capable of handling most kinds of metabolomic data and was designed to perform most of the common kinds of metabolomic data analyses. MetaboAnalyst is accessible at http://www.metaboanalyst.ca},

In this paper, we suggest a workflow for significant reduction of the analytical error using pooled calibration samples and multiple internal standard strategy. Between and within batch calibration techniques are applied and the analytical error is reduced significantly (increase of 25\% of peaks with RSD lower than 20\%) and does not hamper or interfere with statistical analysis of the final data.},

  abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or ``batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes () to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

Typically employed reversed-phase (RP) methods fail to target polar metabolites, but the introduction of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) is slow due to perceived issues of reproducibility and ruggedness and a limited understanding of the complex retention mechanisms. In this study, we present a comparison of the chromatographic performance of a traditional RP-C18 column with zwitterionic, amide-, alkyl diol-, and aminoalkyl-based HILIC and mixed-mode columns. Our metabolite library represents one of the largest analyte sets available and consists of 764 authentic metabolite standards, including amino acids, nucleotides, sugars, and other metabolites, representing all major biological pathways and commonly observed exogenous metabolites (drugs). The coverage, retention patterns, and selectivity of the individual methods are highly diverse even between conceptually related HILIC methods. Furthermore, we show that HILIC sorbents having highly orthogonal selectivity and specificity enhance the coverage of major metabolite groups in (semi-) targeted applications compared to RP. Finally, we discuss issues encountered in the analysis of biological samples based on the results obtained with human plasma extracts. Our results demonstrate that fast and highly reproducible separations on zwitterionic columns are feasible, but knowledge of analyte properties is essential to avoid chromatographic bias and exclusion of key analytes in metabolomics studies.Graphical AbstractThe chromatographic parameters of 764 authentic metabolite standards provide the basis for a comparison of coverage, selectivity and orthogonality of 7 reversed-phase (RP), mixed-mode (MM) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) methods},

This approach offers a global view on metabolic regulation in comparative metabolomics. We implemented our approach in the web application ``MetFamily'', which is freely available at http://msbi.ipb-halle.de/MetFamily/. MetFamily provides a dynamic link between the patterns based on MS1-signal intensity and the corresponding structural similarity at the MS/MS level. Structurally related metabolites are annotated as metabolite families based on a hierarchical cluster analysis of measured MS/MS spectra. Joint examination with principal component analysis of MS1 patterns, where this annotation is preserved in the loadings, facilitates the interpretation of comparative metabolomics data at the level of metabolite families. As a proof of concept, we identified two trichome-specific metabolite families from wild-type tomato Solanum habrochaites LA1777 in a fully unsupervised manner and validated our findings based on earlier publications and with NMR.},

Upstream biological disruptions result in a series of metabolomic changes and, as such, the metabolome holds a wealth of information that is thought to be most predictive of phenotype. Uncovering this knowledge is a work in progress. The field of metabolomics is still maturing; the community has leveraged proteomics experience when applicable and developed a range of sample preparation and instrument methodology along with myriad data processing and analysis approaches. Research focuses have now shifted toward a fundamental understanding of the biology responsible for metabolomic changes. There are several types of metabolomics experiments including both targeted and untargeted analyses. While untargeted, hypothesis generating workflows exhibit many valuable attributes, challenges inherent to the approach remain. This Critical Insight comments on these challenges, focusing on the identification process of LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics studies\textemdash{}specifically in mammalian systems. Biological interpretation of metabolomics data hinges on the ability to accurately identify metabolites. The range of confidence associated with identifications that is often overlooked is reviewed, and opportunities for advancing the metabolomics field are described.Graphical Abstractᅟ},

  abstract = {Arsenic is a widespread metalloid in environment, whose exposure has been associated with a broad spectrum of toxic effects. However, a global view of arsenic-induced male reproductive toxicity is still lack, and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. Our results revealed that arsenic exposure decreased testosterone level and reduced sperm quality in rats. By conducting an integrated proteomics and metabolomics analysis, the present study aims to investigate the global influence of arsenic exposure on the proteome and metabolome in rat testis. The abundance of 70 proteins (36 up-regulated and 34 down-regulated) and 13 metabolites (8 increased and 5 decreased) were found to be significantly altered by arsenic treatment. Among these, 19 proteins and 2 metabolites were specifically related to male reproductive system development and function, including spermatogenesis, sperm function and fertilization, fertility, internal genitalia development, and mating behavior. It is further proposed that arsenic mainly impaired spermatogenesis and fertilization via aberrant modulation of these male reproduction-related proteins and metabolites, which may be mediated by the ERK/AKT/NF-$\kappa$B-dependent signaling pathway. Overall, these findings will aid our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for arsenic-induced male reproductive toxicity, and from such studies useful biomarkers indicative of arsenic exposure could be discovered.},

  abstract = {Instrumental developments in sensitivity and selectivity boost the application of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in metabolomics. Gradual changes in the LC-MS instrumental response (i.e. intra-batch effect) are often unavoidable and they reduce the repeatability and reproducibility of the analysis, decrease the power to detect biological responses and hinder the interpretation of the information provided. Because of that, there is interest in the development of chemometric techniques for the post-acquisition correction of batch effects. In this work, the use of quality control (QC) samples and support vector regression (QC-SVRC) and a radial basis function kernel is proposed to correct intra-batch effects. The repeated analysis of a single sample is used for the assessment of both the correction accuracy and the effect of the distribution of QC samples throughout the batch. The QC-SVRC method is evaluated and compared with a recently developed method based on QC samples and robust cubic smoothing splines (QC-RSC). The results show that QC-SVRC slightly outperformed QC-RSC and allows a straightforward fitting of the SVRC parameters to the instrument performance by using the $\epsilon$-insensitive loss parameter.},

However, little is known about the effects of DMY in the context of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Male Sprague-Dawley(SD) rats were fed a HFD(60\% fat) supplemented with DMY for 8 weeks. The administration of DMY to the rats with HFD-induced insulin resistance reduces hyperglycemia, plasma levels of insulin, and steatosis in the liver. Furthermore, DMY treatment modulated 24 metabolic pathways, including glucose metabolism, the TCA cycle. DMY significantly enhanced glucose uptake and improved the translocation of glucose transporter 1. The specificity of DMY promoted the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In addition, the exposure of HepG2 cells to high glucose concentrations impaired the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt2 Ser474 and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) Ser612, increased GSK-3$\beta$ phosphorylation, and upregulated G6Pase and PEPCK expression. Collectively, DMY improved glucose-related metabolism while reducing lipid levels in the HFD-fed rats. These data suggest that DMY might be a useful drug for use in type 2 diabetes insulin resistance therapy and for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.},

Among the computational algorithms within a workflow, deconvolution is critical since it reconstructs a pure mass spectrum for each component that the mass spectrometer observes. Based on the pure spectrum, the corresponding component can be eventually identified and quantified. Deconvolution is challenging due to the existence of co-elution. In this review, we focus on progress that has been made in the development of deconvolution algorithms and provide thoughts on future developments that will expand the application of GC-MS in metabolomics.},

Metabolomics can offer an alternative tool for unveiling new insights in the discovery of new treatments and biomarkers of mental disorders. Until now, most of metabolomic studies have been based on biofluids: serum/plasma or urine, because brain tissue accessibility is limited to animal models or post mortem studies, but even so it is crucial for understanding the pathological processes. Metabolomics studies of brain tissue imply several challenges due to sample extraction, along with brain heterogeneity, sample storage, and sample treatment for a wide coverage of metabolites with a wide range of concentrations of many lipophilic and some polar compounds. In this review, the current analytical practices for target and non-targeted metabolomics are described and discussed with emphasis on critical aspects: sample treatment (quenching, homogenization, filtration, centrifugation and extraction), analytical methods, as well as findings considering the used strategies. Besides that, the altered analytes in the different brain regions have been associated with their corresponding pathways to obtain a global overview of their dysregulation, trying to establish the link between altered biological pathways and pathophysiological conditions.},

  abstract = {The aim of untargeted metabolomics is to profile as many metabolites as possible, yet a major challenge is comparing experimental method performance on the basis of metabolome coverage. To date, most published approaches have compared experimental methods by counting the total number of features detected. Due to artifactual interference, however, this number is highly variable and therefore is a poor metric for comparing metabolomic methods. Here we introduce an alternative approach to benchmarking metabolome coverage which relies on mixed Escherichia coli extracts from cells cultured in regular and 13C-enriched media. After mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis of these extracts, we ``credential'' features arising from E. coli metabolites on the basis of isotope spacing and intensity. This credentialing platform enables us to accurately compare the number of nonartifactual features yielded by different experimental approaches. We highlight the value of our platform by reoptimizing a published untargeted metabolomic method for XCMS data processing. Compared to the published parameters, the new XCMS parameters decrease the total number of features by 15\% (a reduction in noise features) while increasing the number of true metabolites detected and grouped by 20\%. Our credentialing platform relies on easily generated E. coli samples and a simple software algorithm that is freely available on our laboratory Web site (http://pattilab.wustl.edu/software/credential/). We have validated the credentialing platform with reversed-phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography as well as Agilent, Thermo Scientific, AB SCIEX, and LECO mass spectrometers. Thus, the credentialing platform can readily be applied by any laboratory to optimize their untargeted metabolomic pipeline for metabolite extraction, chromatographic separation, mass spectrometric detection, and bioinformatic processing.},

Although performing pairwise comparisons alone can provide physiologically relevant data, these experiments often result in hundreds of differences, and comparison with additional biologically meaningful sample groups can allow for substantial data reduction. By performing second-order (meta-) analysis, metaXCMS facilitates the prioritization of interesting metabolite features from large untargeted metabolomic data sets before the rate-limiting step of structural identification. Here we provide a detailed step-by-step protocol for going from raw mass spectrometry data to metaXCMS results, visualized as Venn diagrams and exported Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. There is no upper limit to the number of sample groups or individual samples that can be compared with the software, and data from most commercial mass spectrometers are supported.

The membrane is comprised of poly(divinylbenzene) (DVB) resin particles suspended in a high-density polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) glue, which is spread onto a carbon fiber mesh. The currently presented membrane was shown to exhibit a substantially lesser amount of siloxane bleed during thermal desorption, while providing a statistically similar extraction efficiency toward a broad spectrum of analytes varying in polarity when compared to an unsupported DVB/PDMS membrane of similar shape and size which was prepared with previously published methods. With the use of hand-portable GC-TMS instrumentation, membranes cut with dimensions 40 mm long by 4.85 mm wide and 40 $\pm$ 5 $\mu$m thick (per side) were shown to extract 21.2, 19.8, 18.5, 18,4, 26.8, and 23.7 times the amount of 2,4 dichlorophenol, 2,4,6 trichlorophenol, phorate D10, fonofos, chloropyrifos, and parathion, respectively, within 15 min from a 10 ppb aqueous solution as compared to a 65 $\mu$m DVB/PDMS solid phase microextraction (SPME) fiber. A portable high volume desorption module prototype was also evaluated and shown to be appropriate for the desorption of analytes with a volatility equal to or lesser than benzene when employed in conjunction with TFME membranes. Indeed, the coupling of these TFME devices to hand-portable gas chromatography toroidial ion trap mass spectrometry (GC-TMS) instrumentation was shown to push detection limits for these pesticides down to the hundreds of ppt levels, nearing that which can be achieved with benchtop instrumentation. Where these membranes can also be coupled to benchtop instrumentation it is reasonable to assume that detection limits could be pushed down even further. As a final proof of the concept, the first ever, entirely on-site TFME-GC-TMS analysis was performed at a construction impacted lake. Results had indicated the presence of contaminants such as toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol diisobutyrate, and tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate, which stood out from other naturally occurring compounds detected.},

Tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle and a number of amino acid-related biological pathways were disturbed. Some antioxidant levels (cis-caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid, dehydroascorbic acid) were significantly decreased compared to the control, indicating that oxidative stress and a defense response occurred. Nicotianamine, a copper chelator, increased by 12\textendash{}27 fold compared to the control, which may represent a detoxification mechanism. The up-regulation of polyamines (spermidine and putrescine) and potassium may mitigate oxidative stress and enhance tolerance. The data presented here provide a molecular-scale perspective on the response of plants to copper nanopesticides.},

  abstract = {Silkworm (Bombyx mori) is a very useful target insect for evaluation of endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs) due to mature breeding techniques, complete endocrine system and broad basic knowledge on developmental biology. Comparative metabolomics of silkworms with and without EDC exposure offers another dimension of studying EDCs. In this work, we report a workflow on metabolomic profiling of silkworm hemolymph based on high-performance chemical isotope labeling (CIL) liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and demonstrate its application in studying the metabolic changes associated with the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) exposure in silkworm. Hemolymph samples were taken from mature silkworms after growing on diet that contained DDT at four different concentrations (1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001~ppm) as well as on diet without DDT as controls. They were subjected to differential 12C-/13C-dansyl labeling of the amine/phenol submetabolome, LC-UV quantification of the total amount of labeled metabolites for sample normalization, and LC-MS detection and relative quantification of individual metabolites in comparative samples. The total concentration of labeled metabolites did not show any significant change between four DDT-treatment groups and one control group. Multivariate statistical analysis of the metabolome data set showed that there was a distinct metabolomic separation between the five groups. Out of the 2044 detected peak pairs, 338 and 1471 metabolites have been putatively identified against the HMDB database and the EML library, respectively. 65 metabolites were identified by the dansyl library searching based on the accurate mass and retention time. Among the 65 identified metabolites, 33 positive metabolites had changes of greater than 1.20-fold or less than 0.83-fold in one or more groups with p-value of smaller than 0.05. Several useful biomarkers including serine, methionine, tryptophan, asymmetric dimethylarginine, N-Methyl-D-aspartic and tyrosine were identified. The changes of these biomarkers were likely due to the disruption of the endocrine system of silkworm by DDT. This work illustrates that the method of CIL LC-MS is useful to generate quantitative submetabolome profiles from a small volume of silkworm hemolymph with much higher coverage than conventional LC-MS methods, thereby facilitating the discovery of potential metabolite biomarkers related to EDC or other chemical exposure.},

  abstract = {This study presents a thorough evaluation of new prototypes of extended tip needle trap devices (NT), as well as their application to in situ sampling of biological emissions and active/passive on-site sampling of indoor air. A new NT prototype was constructed with a side hole above the sorbent and an extended tip that fits inside the restriction of the narrow neck liner to increase desorption efficiency. New prototype needles were initially packed with divinylbenzene particles at SGE Analytical Science for the purpose of studying biogenic emissions of pine trees. Prior to their final application, they were evaluated in terms of robustness after multiple use (n $>$ 10), as well as amount extracted of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). An ANOVA test for all the probes showed that at a 95\% level of confidence, there were not statistical differences observed among the 9 NTs tested. In addition, the needles were also packed in laboratory with synthesized highly cross-linked PDMS as a frit to immobilize carboxen (Car) particles for spot sampling. For passive sampling, the needles were packed with Car particles embedded in PDMS to simplify calculations in passive mode. The use of NTs as spot samplers, as well as a passive sampler under controlled conditions in the laboratoryyielded a relative standard deviation of less than 15\%. Finally, a new, reusable and readily deployable penlike diffusive sampler for needle traps (PDS-NT) was built and tested. Application of the PDS-NT in combination with NT-spot sampling toward the analysis of indoor air in a polymer synthesis laboratory showed good agreement between both techniques for the analyte studied, yielding averages of 0.03 and 0.025 ng/mL of toluene, respectively.},

  abstract = {Microarrays are a novel technology that facilitates the simultaneous measurement of thousands of gene expression levels. A typical microarray experiment can produce millions of data points, raising serious problems of data reduction, and simultaneous inference. We consider one such experiment in which oligonucleotide arrays were employed to assess the genetic effects of ionizing radiation on seven thousand human genes. A simple nonparametric empirical Bayes model is introduced, which is used to guide the efficient reduction of the data to a single summary statistic per gene, and also to make simultaneous inferences concerning which genes were affected by the radiation. Although our focus is on one specific experiment, the proposed methods can be applied quite generally. The empirical Bayes inferences are closely related to the frequentist false discovery rate (FDR) criterion.},

  abstract = {Background   Optimizing resuscitation is important to prevent morbidity and mortality from perinatal asphyxia. The metabolism of cells and tissues is severely disturbed during asphyxia and resuscitation, and metabolomic analyses provide a snapshot of many small molecular weight metabolites in body fluids or tissues. In this study metabolomics profiles were studied in newborn pigs that were asphyxiated and resuscitated using different protocols to identify biomarkers for subject characterization, intervention effects and possibly prognosis.       Methods   A total of 125 newborn Noroc pigs were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated and inflicted progressive asphyxia until asystole. Pigs were randomized to resuscitation with a FiO 2  0.21 or 1.0, different duration of ventilation before initiation of chest compressions (CC), and different CC to ventilation ratios. Plasma and urine samples were obtained at baseline, and 2 h and 4 h after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC, heart rate \&gt; = 100 bpm). Metabolomics profiles of the samples were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.       Results   Plasma and urine showed severe metabolic alterations consistent with hypoxia and acidosis 2 h and 4 h after ROSC. Baseline plasma hypoxanthine and lipoprotein concentrations were inversely correlated to the duration of hypoxia sustained before asystole occurred, but there was no evidence for a differential metabolic response to the different resuscitation protocols or in terms of survival.       Conclusions   Metabolic profiles of asphyxiated newborn pigs showed severe metabolic alterations. Consistent with previously published reports, we found no evidence of differences between established and alternative resuscitation protocols. Lactate and pyruvate may have a prognostic value, but have to be independently confirmed.},

It supports a wide range of complex statistical calculations and high quality graphical rendering functions that require significant computational resources. First introduced in 2009, MetaboAnalyst has experienced more than a 50X growth in user traffic ($>$50 000 jobs processed each month). In order to keep up with the rapidly increasing computational demands and a growing number of requests to support translational and systems biology applications, we performed a substantial rewrite and major feature upgrade of the server. The result is MetaboAnalyst 3.0. By completely re-implementing the MetaboAnalyst suite using the latest web framework technologies, we have been able substantially improve its performance, capacity and user interactivity. Three new modules have also been added including: (i) a module for biomarker analysis based on the calculation of receiver operating characteristic curves; (ii) a module for sample size estimation and power analysis for improved planning of metabolomics studies and (iii) a module to support integrative pathway analysis for both genes and metabolites. In addition, popular features found in existing modules have been significantly enhanced by upgrading the graphical output, expanding the compound libraries and by adding support for more diverse organisms.},
